# ようこそ!

I'm Eddie, a Web/Backend Developer who works for [Gluru](https://gluru.co/). I am interested languages, tea, [polyphasic sleeping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep) and productivity. Always trying to make more time in the day to explore new things.

This blog doesn't get updated as often as I would like, but you can contact me on twitter, [@moukiio](https://twitter.com/moukiio).
