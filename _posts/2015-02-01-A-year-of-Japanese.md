title: A year of Japanese

The deeper I get into learning Japanese, I find the concept of learning a language fascinating. Up until a year ago, English was the only language I knew.. 

Being a Software Developer, I am used to learning quickly and moving fast, this is very different to learning a natural language, it takes dedication and time.

I started studying Japanese about a year ago, I have studied every day for the past year in some shape or form without fail. Whilst being unwell, on holiday or under a tight dead line with work.

It’s a long difficult process, it’s full of peeks and dips, but it’s extremely rewarding.

Only recently have I begun to immerse myself in the language more and more, watching Japanese shows, listening to the news whilst working, reading whenever I get a chance and scribbling random Kanji on my whiteboard.

It slowly hit me that I am finally understanding the language, all the small little blocks lining up and creating a path, so much information changing the way I think and process thoughts, changing me.

Self studying Japanese has helped me gain self discipline and the ability to manage myself, to know how to tackle huge projects and break them down.  

Sometimes it’s hard to remember why I started learning Japanese, but I guess this post spawned from a peek, it's a reminder to myself, why I study everyday.

Every time I’m having a bad day, this quote always comes to me. I guess it's quite appropriate now.
