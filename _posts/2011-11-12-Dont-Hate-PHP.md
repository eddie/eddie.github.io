title: "Don't hate PHP"

I've been developing with PHP on and off for the past few years, and one thing I've learnt is that there are haters. Including myself. Each day there are new posts on why you shouldn't use PHP and that it doesn't necessarily encourage you to use the 'best' techniques within your code. To an extent, I agree with this but as we all know PHP is staying right where it is for reasons I wont go into.

At my work, I write PHP daily for two reasons; It's the web based programming lanuage I have the most experience with, and all our legacy code is written in it. Recently I have started to use Rails for side projects and being able to use the power of Ruby on the web is just awesome, and when I have to go back to PHP a sigh usually follows. I think at times we can under-appreciate great projects and frameworks because of the language it is written in, and as the saying goes 'the grass is always greener on the other side'.
