I've spent the day working on this new site and putting some code on github and am quite happy how it turned out, it's a one page template with partials for blog posts and is generated from markdown files using Jekyll with the aid of rdiscount. It's got a small foot print and is completly static which makes it ideal to maintain.

I plan to keep the <a href='/thoughts.html'>blog</a> side of things updated more often including non-technical things. Any feedback on the new is welcomed and you can send it to me at eblundell@gmail.com
