Having tried many different ways of studying Japanese, I have found that a lot of traditional methods make it difficult to gain motivation to continue.. More recently I have begun trying to imerse myself in the language, and living in a small town on the coast of Cornwall- this can be quite difficult.

I spend most of my day in a Web browser, so it seemed logical to try and do most of my imersion here. Below is some resources I've collected, some I use daily and some I just browse whilst taking lunch.
